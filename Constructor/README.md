QUESTION :

A sports club needs a program to manage its members. Your task is to define and test a class called Member for this purpose.
Define the Member class using 

Private data members: 
   Member Number, Name, Birthday. 

Public Methods:
   Constructor with one parameter for each data member
   Access methods for each data member.
   The birthday is read-only.
   A method for formatted screen output of all data members.
	
Implement the necessary methods.

Test the new Member class by creating at least two objects with the data of your choice and calling the methods you defined. 

Add a static member called ptrBoss to the class. This pointer indicates the member who has been appointed as chairperson. If no chairperson has 	been appointed, the pointer should point to NULL.

Additionally, define the static access methods getBoss() and setBoss(). Use a pointer to set and return the object in 	question.

Test the Member class by reading the number of an 	existing	member, making the member the new chairperson and 	displaying the	chairperson using getBoss().
