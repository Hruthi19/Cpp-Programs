QUESTION :

A publishing company markets both books and audiocassette versions of its works. Create a class called publication that stores the title (a string) and price (type float) of a publication. From this class derive two classes: book, which adds a page count (type int); and tape, which adds a playing time in minutes (type float). Each of the three class should have a getdata() function to get its data from the user, and a putdata() function to display data. Also include two constants publisher name (a string) and address (type int) in the class publication. These  constants should be initialized at the time of instantiating an object of class publication. 

Write a main() program that creates an array of pointers to publication. In a loop ask the user for data about a particular book or tape, and use new to create an object of type book or tape to hold the data. Put the pointer to the object in the array. When the user has finished entering the data for all books and tapes, display the resulting data for all books and tapes entered using a loop.
